# Kerala-IOT-Challenge
Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation
# About Me
Hi everyone! I'm Ashil George P G.I'm currently pursuing BTech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from ALBERTIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY [AISAT], ERNAKULAM. My major area of interests are IOT,Aeromodelling ,Drones and RC planes piloting,programming etc.
# Experiment 1 : Hello World LED Blinking
A basic program similar to printing "Hello World" in any programming language. The aim is to blink an LED using Arduino Uno Board.

Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

## Components Required  
* Arduino Uno Board 
* USB Cable 
* LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
* 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos
* Breadboard 
* Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

## Code

```
int ledPin = 10; // define digital pin 10.
void setup()
{
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);// define pin with LED connected as output.
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // set the LED on.
delay(1000); // wait for a second.
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // set the LED off.
delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
```

## Output
> The LED is blinked with a time interval of 1 second
